/*
 * What is Dynamic Method Dispatch?
 * Dynamic Method Dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method
 * is resolved at runtime, rather than at compile time.

 * It allows Java to support runtime polymorphism â€” the ability to call the 
 * correct overridden method of a subclass or implementing class through a superclass/interface reference.
