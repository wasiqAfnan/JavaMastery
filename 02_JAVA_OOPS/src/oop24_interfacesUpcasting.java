/*
 * Interface-Based Upcasting and Dynamic Method Dispatch
In Java, interface-based upcasting allows us to refer to an object of a class
(that implements one or more interfaces) using a reference of the interface type.
This is similar to class-based upcasting but involves interfaces instead of 
parent classes.

When we upcast, we restrict access to only the methods defined in the interface,
even though the actual object may implement more methods. At runtime,
Java dynamically calls the correct method implementation from the class,
not the interface â€” this is known as dynamic method dispatch.

// Interface 1: Engine-powered vehicles
interface EnginePowered {
    void startEngine(); // Abstract method

// Interface 2: Electric-powered vehicles

// Class: Car that implements both interfaces
class Car implements EnginePowered, ElectricPowered {
    // Implementing EnginePowered method
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Starting engine of the car.");
    }
