Step 1:- Install Jdk to your pc
Step 2:- Now go to where you install jdk and then go to jdk->bin copy the path and goto advance System Setting-> Environment Variables -> system variables click on path then new and paste the copied path which you copy from jdk->bin
Step 3:- Install mysql to your pc (choose custom option under installation then choose latest server,latest workbench, latest shell and also you can get the jar file under mysql connectors option)
Step 4:- Download mysql-connector.jar file of the same version as of your mysql version
Step 5:- Copy the whole path along with name of the mysql-connector.jar
Step 6:- Again go to advance System Setting-> Environment Variables -> user variable click new under variable name type 'classpath' and in variable value paste the path where you place your connector.jar file along with its name and extension
Step 7:- now open cmd and type 'javap com.mysql.jdbc.Driver' hit enter. If you see 'class not found' then you have to be sure that you added class path properly. 
         But if you see the following:

         Compiled from "Driver.java"
         public class com.mysql.jdbc.Driver extends com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver {
         public com.mysql.jdbc.Driver() throws java.sql.SQLException;
         static {};
         }

         it means you have succesfully added mysql drivers to your pc and your jdbc can connect to the database.
step 8: IMPORTANT: Verify MySQL port before setting the URL.
        Default is 3306, but it can differ (e.g., 3406).
        To check the port being used:
            Path => C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.4\my.ini
            1. Open MySQL config file (my.ini) → look for "port="
            2. Or run in terminal: netstat -ano | findstr mysqld
            3. Or check MySQL Workbench → "Server Status"
        Make sure the port here matches the actual MySQL port.
step 9:- after this open vs code and create new java project then type the following and run the code:

** make sure you have created the 'my-db' database in the mysql server before running the code

import java.sql.*;
public class jdbc_1_connection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try{
            /* Step 1 */
            // loading jdbc sql drivers

            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

            /* Step 2 */
            // setup url username and password

            String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_db";
            String userName = "root";
            String password = "root";

            /* Step 3 */
            // creating connenction to the database named my_db

            Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, userName, password);

            /* Step 4 */
            // checking connection has established or not.

            if(con.isClosed()){
                System.out.println("Connection failed");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("Connection Successful");
            }

            /* Step 5 */
            // closing the connection.

            con.close();

        }catch(Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

if the output is successful then you have successfully connected to the server...woooaaahhh!!!!
