/*
 * Problem Statement

    You are given an array prices where prices[i] represents the price of a stock
    on the i-th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day 
    to buy one stock and a later day in the future to sell that stock.

    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5

    Explanation:
    Buy on day 2 (price = 1), sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 âˆ’ 1 = 5.
    You cannot sell before buying, so only future days are valid.

    What is required: Find the maximum profit possible. 
    If no profit can be made (prices always decrease), return 0.
